Skyfall is an open source Python Windows Chrome Credential Stealer that reports its findings with a discord message through Discord Webhooks.

## How does it work?

Like mentioned above, this tool is written in Python and can be used on Windows to exfiltrate saved Chrome credentials. Once it finds one it will send a message to your Discord server via Discord Webhooks which will contain all the Chrome saved passwords and the computer username.
